## What is Inkball?
Inkball is a classic puzzle game originally developed by Microsoft, where players draw lines to guide balls into designated holes.
The goal is to direct colored balls into matching holes by strategically creating barriers and pathways with ink. Score will only increase if the colour of a ball matches the colour of the hole, provided that the ball or hole isn't grey.
