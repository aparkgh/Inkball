## What is Inkball?
**Inkball** is a classic puzzle game originally developed by Microsoft, where players draw lines to guide balls into designated holes.
The goal is to direct colored balls into matching holes by strategically creating barriers and pathways with ink. Score will only increase if the colour of a ball matches the colour of the hole, provided that the ball or hole isn't grey.

## What is Gradle?
**Gradle** is a powerful build automation tool used for managing dependencies, compiling code, and running tasks in software projects. It is particularly popular in Java development for automating the build process, handling large-scale projects efficiently, and integrating with IDEs. Gradle allows developers to write flexible build scripts and use plugins to simplify tasks like testing, packaging, and running applications. Its ability to handle complex project structures and its performance optimizations make it a go-to tool for modern development workflows.
